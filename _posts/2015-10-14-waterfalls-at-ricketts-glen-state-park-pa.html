<p>For my 36th birthday, I decided I wanted to see some waterfalls. Steph and I did some research and learned about <a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/rickettsglen/" target="_new">Ricketts Glen State Park</a> - only a few hours from our home in Philadelphia. So we decided to check it out.</p>

<p>There is a 7 mile trail that goes past 22 waterfalls. The trail is well marked and clear of obstacles. For the most part, it's an easy trail but there are some steep parts as you ascend some of the higher falls. Being a loop, as you can imagine, you will spend half the trail descending and the other half ascending.</p>

<p>This was the first time I ever went on a "hike". I don't want to get into too much detail about that because I have another post planned about my new interest in hiking.</p>

<p>The highest fall is 94 feet tall and it's impressive. We ate lunch at the bottom of this one. However, I found a lot of the smaller waterfalls to be intriguing as well. Something about the way they cascade haphazardly.</p>

<p>The trail itself has a few other cool landscapes as well. There is a rock bridge and a few small cliffs and mossy crags. The trail, at least when we were there, was well traveled. There were a few moments during our walk where we were 'by ourselves', but for the most part, we could see other folks.</p>

<p>I chose <em>DÃ©livrance</em> by <strong>Alcest</strong> as the soundtrack for this walk. I think the way that the song builds slowly and ends powerfully matches the enthusiasm that grew in me as I took this hike. In the beginning, I just wanted to see some waterfalls. The longer I spent under the tree cover on that trail, the more I felt that this is something I wanted to do a lot more of.</p>
