<p>For the past year, I've been working in an environment where pair programming is strictly enforced. This is the first post in what will most likely become a series of blog posts where I collect my thoughts on pair programming.</p>

<h3>Some Background</h3>

<p>I've had a curiosity about pair programming since first falling into the Agile methodology material and the XP value system. Further research on the subject led me to many blog posts that re-asserted it benefits: shared code ownership, less defects and higher code quality, etc. I found almost no material providing negatives of pair programming other than the occassional article about how it results in less lines of code written by management types. Since I'm not a manager or in any way in charge of signing someone's paycheck, the amount of code a developer produces has never been a compelling argument to me one way or another. And I won't be covering that aspect that in this series.</p>

<p>About a year and a half ago, I interviewed at a company whose developers practiced pair programming as part of their every day working arrangements. I received an offer but turned it down, partly due to the compensation and benefits package being less than ideal, but also because I got cold feet about the prospect of pair programming. It scared me.</p>

<p>A few months later, I interviewed at yet another company who also practiced pairing and this time, I accepted the position. I really wanted to give it a shot. Up until that point, I'd been developing software in mostly the same way for my whole career and I felt like this would be a great change of pace. I came into it hopeful that my lingering doubts were based on fear of change and that the experience would be very beneficial.</p>

<p>After a year of pairing, I can confidently say that pairing is not for me. Let me reiterate: <strong>it's not for me</strong>. I chose those words very carefully. This isn't blanket advice to pair or not to pair. I think there's too much prescriptive advice in our industry. Instead, over the next few posts, I will get into the good and the bad of pair programming - with the very obvious caveat that its all from my perspective. Because one thing I do have to thank pairing for is the experience. It has helped me realize how I am most creative and productive. The old saying "you don't know until you try" applies here. I credit pairing with helping me realize what things are important to me in my personal creative process.</p>

<p>So let's get into it... first up, let's talk about where <a href="/2013/11/20/my-thoughts-on-pair-programming-the-good.html">pair programming is good</a>.</p>
