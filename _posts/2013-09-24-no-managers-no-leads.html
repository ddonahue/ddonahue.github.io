title: No Managers, No Leads... Just Great Workers

<p>I've seen a few articles recently of companies who have realized that management does more harm than good. I figured I'd share.</p>

<p>The most recent about a company called Treehouse (http://ryancarson.com/post/61562761297/no-managers-why-we-removed-bosses-at-treehouse). And it's the start of a series if you decide you want to follow the posts. But basically, they realized that as their company grew and the number of managers grew that they saw more rumors, politics and morale problems. They realized that what drives people is not performance reviews and being pushed by managers - people naturally want to do good work.</p>

<p>This is not a new concept. Many companies whom developers believe to be utopian have done the same - GitHub, Valve, etc.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, a video is referenced in that blog post that I'd watched a few years ago called Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc). It's an incredible video - definitely worth the 10 minutes. It talks about how people naturally want to do good work and want freedom moreso than monetary or other "carrots on a stick":</p>

<p>Here's a post by a Github dude about their setup and lack of managers: http://zachholman.com/posts/scaling-github-employees/</p>

<p>And you want a testament to Github's strong focus on a happy work environment? Check no further than this tweet: https://twitter.com/holman/status/303576839132164097</p>

<p>In case you don't feel like clicking links, let me just shout it at you:</p>

<p>"GitHub hit the 150 employee mark this morning (2/28/13). About ? are remote. Never had anyone quit. Worrying about how your company works pays off."</p>

<p>150 employees!!! That's 3x the size of the Philly Algo office!!!! Not one person has EVER quit. Let that sink in for a minute.</p>

<p>Now granted, GitHub is more than likely an outlier. And I'm sure there are practices that in our case, either shouldn't or couldn't be employed for Algo. But c'mon, with a story like that, don't you think it's worth a look at how they work (which is readily available - many of their employees speak to it in blogs, videos, etc.) to see if there are things we could bring here to make this a more ideal workplace for many of the employees of Algo? At the very least, the overarching theme of paying CLOSE attention to the way Algo works with an eye towards changing things that don't work is something we should be doing.</p>

<p>Lastly - I found this in my twitter timeline this morning: http://www.leanblog.org/2011/04/podcast-117-samuel-a-culbert-get-rid-of-the-performance-review/</p>

<p>A podcast about getting rid of the performance review. I couldn't agree more. I've been one of the seemingly few in the office who has been vocal about my distaste of all things management. I was once asked by someone at Algo "when all the developers were being managed by one person, didn't it bother you that your manager is stretched too thin about has no visibility into your performance vs. the other developers?" And I replied "not in the slightest". Not worrying about that means I can worry about getting real work done - the code I get paid (and quite enjoy) to write. And solving the technical and domain problems. That's what drives me. I believe that's what drives most people (at least developers).</p>

<p>I think I'm spent. If anyone wants to talk about hierarchy or have any other ideas for making the office the type of place you're excited to come to every day rather than dreading, you know where to find me.</p>
