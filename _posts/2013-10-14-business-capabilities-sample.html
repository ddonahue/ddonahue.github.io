<p>I spent a few days of odd time/lunches whipping up an insanely small sample web application that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Uses messaging (NServiceBus) as its backbone.</li>
  <li>Composes a UI from read services provided by each service.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>It is available for anyone to download via:</p>

<p><strong>git clone git@phiv5code.uspa.ibm.com:messaging-demo</strong></p>

<p>Let me know if you any problems getting the code or getting it to run. I built it on my laptop so it uses .NET 4.5 and VS2012.</p>

<p>My hope was that, although simple, it provides a starting point to show people how a system broken out into services could be built. I hope it lets people start to reason about how a SOA might look, how messaging works, how UI composition could work, etc. I'm hoping it facilitates conversation. I encourage questions and comments.</p>

<p>I may do a series of follow-up blog posts where I highlight different parts of the project with a more in-depth discussion.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that it's quite obviously a toy application and a lot of care was NOT put into it around removing duplicate code, best practices, etc.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone finds this useful.</p>
