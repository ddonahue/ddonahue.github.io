<p><em>(This post is largely stream of consciousness after a short conversation I overheard recently. Hopefully it is at least slightly coherent.)</em></p>

<p>I was recently pondering the difference between sponsoring a development conference versus sending speakers to the conference. It started to dawn on me that your action as a company may say a lot about what you're looking for in your technology department.</p>

<p>Let's first level the playing field and say that your motivation for doing either is probably to bring some sort of recognition to your company. I'd say it's most likely a recruiting effort. You may be building software that you hope developers will use to aid their work, but it's far more likely that you build a product and you're hoping a few of them may want to come work on making your product bigger and better(tm).</p>

<p>And what better place to do it? You have a building full of developers who clearly are interested in personal development.</p>

<h2>The Message You Send</h2>

<p>If you have employees that present at the conference, they have a chance to connect with developers on a deeper level. They'll talk about the challenges they've faced and highlight solutions they've come up with. They might even give a talk about how they tried something that did <em>not</em> work out and the lessons learned from doing so. They'll have a chance to highlight what makes your product technically engaging. And while that may be the last of your concerns as a business owner, that's what makes many developers tick.</p>

<p>On the other hand, simply sponsoring an event shows monetary support. That's the only value proposition that is delivered - that you're a thriving company. Some people like to know that their prospective employers have capital and stability.</p>

<h2>So Which Is Right?</h2>

<p>I've probably made <em>my</em> personal preference a little too clear in the last few paragraphs. I've also made the sides too black and white. There are plenty of cases where a sponsor also has speakers who deliver amazing talks. There are cases where a speaker delivers a talk that flops. There are too many variables to consider. Hence - stream of consciousness.</p>

<p>The point is that businesses have to decide what type of developer they want to hire. Then they need to pay a lot of attention to the message they're sending about their company so as to attract those types of developers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, developers have to determine what type of company they want to work for. And they need to find ways to distill the information they receive from prospective employers to figure out if they're well-suited to be successful and engaged.</p>

<p>This all sounds very obvious. Most companies are going to say they want extremely passionate developers who like to solve challenging technical problems. But not all companies have challenging technical problems. Some don't even really want programmers for much more than keeping their product viable in the market. And that's completely fine. The problem comes when one side isn't honest about what they're looking for.</p>

<p>Or perhaps the point is that you should try to showcase all of your value by both sponsoring conferences and empowering your employees to give a talk!</p>

<p>End rant.</p>
