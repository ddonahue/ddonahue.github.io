<p>Once upon a time, there was a developer who had recently graduated college. He was a confident and charismatic young lad who liked to think about and attempt to solve challenging problems. He was te type of go-getter that companies love. And he was on a team of senior developers who were mentoring him. It was a perfect situation. But it fell apart.</p>

<p>The young, confident developer emphatically refused to be seen as a junior developer. He refused to take advice of the older, experienced developers around him. And eventually, he spoke to his manager and requested to be taken off this team and placed on a team by himself. The request was granted.</p>

<p>On this new team-of-one, the young developer was given a greenfield project. He wrote it all by himself and was quite proud of it.</p>

<p>After a few months, he decided he wanted to join another existing team and he was again granted his request. The project he worked on in isolation was handed off to a different set of developers ot maintain.</p>

<p>The new maintainers of this codebase quickly raised red flags about the code quality. Their morale dropped because they were being handed a mess and were asked to clean it up. Further, clients using the code sent the young developer an email saying "there are a lot of problems with this software and we need them fixed." His response? "I no longer work on that project. Please get in touch with the new maintainers about these problems."</p>

<p>The office hears about this morass and the proposed solution is to have all of the developers come up with a process that stops this from happening again. Now morale amongst ALL the developers is down...</p>

<p>This story has no conclusion. It doesn't matter if it's fiction or non-fiction, similar situations occur all the time. What I plan to do is to elaborate on what I see are the problem points in this scenario and they'd be addressed in an ideal world. I would love to hear more opinions in the comments as to what problems you see, how you'd address them, etc. So without further ado, here's my take.</p>
