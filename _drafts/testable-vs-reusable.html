<p>Talk about why passing in dependencies is more about reusability than testing. Testing is a side benefit of dependency injection, not the main goal. And talk about how if you just put interfaces on things to test, you're doing your codebase a disservice. Because while it will be testable, it won't be AS reusable. It'll still be oriented to a single purpose. You have to actually do design to figure out how make a design less resistant to change.</p>
