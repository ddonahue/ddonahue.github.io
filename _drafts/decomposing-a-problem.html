- Breaking a problem down. Most devs, including myself, don't go deep enough.
	* Rich Hickey quote
	* Talk about benefits of reusability but ALSO hiding what you DON'T care about.
		- Get users, find users that fit criteria, send them an email.
		- When change comes in to now text them too, you want to be able to add that change to one place. You also want to be able to know EXACTLY where you need to change.. reading through bunches of code to find the part that does what you're looking to change is harder.
		- Breaking a feature into small enough chunks means you can see the algorithm without understanding the minituae.
	* Related to devs being scared of classes (future blog post).
