- Reflect on the first post and comments
- Reflect more on how you feel about the future (the last post was about the past/current)
- Talk about what Sanil said:

"Even in our company, on an average, people with longer service are less competent. Same when we interview people with 10+ years at a single company. So that blog post of talking about your experience has a lot of resemblance with what we see out there.

With the 10+ years at single company, the hardest part is to get them think differently. People get comfortable at a position and then doesn't push themselves."
