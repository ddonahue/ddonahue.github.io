title: Temporal Immunity - The Fallacy Of "Old Code"

<p>Is code ever really old? What does old code even mean? Or is saying "that code is old" a form of temporal immunity? A statement implying that the statute of limitations has run out for the code to be qualitatively reviewed?</p>

<p>While adding a new feature recently, my colleagues had to enter a file that has been around for a while. They found themselves in the midst of trying to figure out what a method was doing so that they felt confident changing it to support the feature they were working on. The method looked like this pseudo-code:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ddonahue/d8bde9a142b305e392f4.js"></script>

<p>It's over 300 lines long with nested if statements, multiple switch statements and yes, that comment was actually in there verbatim.</p>

<p>The developers mentioned in our developers Slack channel that the comment was unhelpful and another developer responded: "Wow! Even <strong></strong>old code</strong> isn't immune to critical scrutiny."</p>

<h2>What Is Old?</h2>

<p>I started thinking about that statement: <strong>old code</strong>. What does it mean? When that method was written, it was brand new. Code does not age while it sits idly in a version control system or runs on your server. The only time it ages, per se, is when a developer changes it. And unlike us humans, it can actually get worse OR better over time.</p>

<h2>Code For The Maintainer</h2>

<p>There is a slightly dark saying:</p>

<blockquote>Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</blockquote>

<p>Or the much more upbeat version:</p>

<blockquote>Always code in such a way that if someone a few notches junior picks up the code, they will take pleasure in reading and learning from it.</blockquote>



<p>TODO: Reference the two famous quotes... 'write code as though the next person maintaining is a psycopath who knows where you live." http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeForTheMaintainer</p>
