<p>Re-tell the story of the haiku comment in a 300-line method with nested IFs and multiple switch statements. When you mentioned the comment being unhelpful, a co-worker responded "jeez, even old code isn't safe from scrutiny." But what does old code really mean? It's still part of the app. It still runs. We are in this file, trying to change this 300-line method TODAY so is it really old? Is that just an excuse?</p>

<p>Reference the two famous quotes... 'write code as though the next person maintaining is a psycopath who knows where you live." http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeForTheMaintainer</p>
