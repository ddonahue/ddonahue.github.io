Discuss being honest during job interviews - both sides!!!

- Avoid "first date" interviews where you try to show your best side. Or the company presents itself as the company they want to be, rather than the company they are.

- It's OK to say you're not there yet. But you'd like to be. Or maybe you don't.

- Use example of the interview in Chicago where they started out by saying how many hours they work and asked if that was OK. And you told them that you weren't interested in doing that. And that the exchange was surprisingly cordial and helpful.

- Use examples where places were less than honest about practices too.
