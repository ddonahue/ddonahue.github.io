Every design has tradeoffs - there are benefits and drawbacks. Give examples (OOP, asynchrony/messaging, procedural, etc.)

Highlight the reasons to consider them:
1) So you can choose the design that gives you the most value with the LEAST drawbacks.
2) So that you can work around the drawbacks as best you can (you can NOT totally rid yourself of them, but it's important to understand them). The worst case would be an unexpected drawback since things are always harder to fix once they're built.
