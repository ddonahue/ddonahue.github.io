<p>First off - I'm sorry for the linkbait-y title of this post. I actually hate myself a little bit for writing it, but I couldn't think of anything more appropriate for the tale that I'm about to describe.</p>

<p>I was at REI the other day looking at Merino wool base layers, backpacks, breathable rainproof coats and hiking boots. A few days earlier I had booked a trip to Iceland for next June. I was planning on doing a 16 mile hike one of the days while I was there. Nevermind the fact that <em>anytime</em> you're outside in Iceland, you're hiking. I paused in the store, bewildered. How did I get here?</p>

<h2>How It Began</h2>
<p>I'm still not entirely sure where it all began. I think about how I spent large portion of my life living in cities and traveling to other cities. As much time as I spend thinking about it, I can never figure out why for my 36th birthday...  </p>
