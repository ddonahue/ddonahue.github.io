Use a method to update an object

Use an interface with just getters and setters

My preference would be the first one. Because:

- you're telling the object to do something. That's what methods are for. Whereas properties are more for accessing data on the object.
- the first one also obscures the internal structure of the object more. It's probably better encapsulation.
- You typically want to update both parts of the name, or the name as a whole, not the pieces.
- Etc.
