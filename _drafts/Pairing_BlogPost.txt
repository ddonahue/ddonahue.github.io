The bad:

- The mental letdown of not seeing things get "done" when you split in the middle of a task. The opposite is true as well: being thrown into the middle of something with very little context.
	
- Haven't seen any noticeable improvements in code quality
	* This is often one of the biggest selling points of pairing.
	* There are still bugs (same amount as other projects). There are still dingy areas of code that no one wants to touch and are hard to change/maintain. There are still poor design decisions that are made in the interest of time or for other reasons.
		- Large codebases also have lots of bugs. Maybe smaller codebase means pairing not necessary?

	* Two brains doesn't NECESSARILY equate to double brain power on a given task.
	* In fact, disagreements about design decisions within a pair cause friction so either:
		- You have them and the pairing session suffers, OR
		- You choose not to bring them up and the design suffers
		- AGAIN - I believe code reviews and other techniques can solve these problems.
	* http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgrammingBenefits - "Also, LaurieWilliams famously demonstrated improved quality for slightly more effort in her The Collaborative Software Process paper (available at http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/dissertation.pdf) [Is this the right one?]. A result that nobody else has been able to recreate since. Laurie is also the author of a book on the benefits of Pair Programming...... "

- Pairing on mundane "non-pair worthy tasks".
	* deleting a bunch of files off a local development machine.
		- One person deleting, another person staring.
	* tasks which are "new" and require studying.
		- Told to break the pair and study alone and then come back and discuss. But this isn't done in practice. There's an unspoken "always be pairing" feeling that neither member wants to broach.
		- http://mwilden.blogspot.com/2009/11/why-i-dont-like-pair-programming-and.html - "Pair programming doesn't encourage quiet reflection and exploration. You can't just sit back and read some code. You can't just sit and think. I mean, you can, but then your pair is just sitting there. If you both agree that such contemplation is necessary, that's fine, but what if your pair is perfectly happy with an existing way? You don't want to waste their time. You don't want to argue (unless the other person wants to as well). You give in more often than if you were working alone."

- Sometimes pairing isn't pairing, but is really "watching someone else code" or "coding while your pair sleeps".
	* I've been on both sides of this. I think it shows the natural desire of each developer to work on their own.
	* One person, often the person with more system experience, will code and code and never tag in the other pair member. If the other pair member doesn't want to rock the boat, they won't ask for control and the session really becomes one programmer coding and the other quietly feeling left out.
	* http://pragprog.com/magazines/2011-07/pair-programming-benefits -  "If you are the weakest player on the team, you will find that pairing gives you an opportunity to learn from your teammates." <-- not true. people have been removed from teams for not being able to code.
